## 📘 Daily Learning Log

### Pythons Function

**Topic:** 
- Learned what a function is and why it is used
- Studied `def` keyword and function syntax
- Understood parameters and return values

**Key Learning:** 
- 'for' loop is useful when iterations are known
- 'while' loop works best for condition-based repetition

**Topics Studied:**Git-Github

- Commit message ka sahi format

**Practice:**
- Ek small Python file me comments add kiye
- GitHub par push kiya
